# Keep me in your prayers -- Prototype

The app is a social prayer tracker, also it will notify to get on praying.

**Keep me in your prayers** is a common saying in the facebook community. People post something like an achievement, or going to do something and ask friends to #keepmeinyourprayers -intending to ask the people to pray for them.

The idea is a social network where people can pray for other people and causes. They can click on the application and record they have prayed.

When they start praying they can include their friends in the prayer. This will record in their profile, the user has prayed X number of times, and also it will send a notification to her friend, user Y has prayed for you.

In the user profile, these numbers will show up:

- User has prayed **x** number of times
- **y** number of people are praying for her
- [ Keep me in your prayers ] button, prompting the visitor to add that person to their praying list.

Users can ask friends to pray for their job, their kids/family, study etc.
